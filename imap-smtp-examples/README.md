# IMAP & SMTP Examples
Examples that demonstrate usage of IMAP and SMTP endpoints in MailSlurp using common tools and languages.

## Credentials
Examples require a MailSlurp API key. Set this in your environment as API_KEY or create a `.env` file containing `API_KEY=YOUR_MAILSLURP_API_KEY`.

Some examples also need to load IMAP and SMTP access credentials. Run the setup scripts to add these credentials to your `.env` file or see the `.env.sample` file and copy those into your `.env` with correct values.
